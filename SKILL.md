        # 🔒 Security & Compliance Skill Suite

        > Derived from **vincenthopf/My-Claude-Code** · Focus: _personal commands, plugins, skills, settings_

        ## Overview

        This skill provides 10 production-ready commands tailored for
        **Security & Compliance** workflows. All commands follow a consistent
        interaction pattern with structured output, progress tracking and
        actionable recommendations.

        ## Available Commands

        - `/owasp-scan` — OWASP Top-10 code scan with exploit description, CVSS score and remediation
- `/dep-cve` — Dependency CVE report with exploitability score and upgrade path
- `/gdpr-audit` — GDPR data-flow map, consent gaps and DPA checklist
- `/soc2-readiness` — SOC 2 Type II readiness gap analysis across all 5 Trust Service Criteria
- `/threat-model` — STRIDE threat model for architecture diagram with risk matrix
- `/pentest-report` — Structured penetration test report: executive summary, findings and remediation
- `/secret-detect` — Pre-commit secret detection hook config with entropy scanning
- `/iam-audit` — IAM least-privilege audit: over-permissioned roles, stale access and MFA gaps
- `/incident-playbook` — Security incident playbook: triage → contain → eradicate → recover → lessons
- `/privacy-policy` — GDPR/CCPA-compliant privacy policy generator from data inventory

        ## Interaction Pattern

        Every command follows this structured response format:

        ```
        1. CONTEXT CHECK   — Verify inputs and confirm scope with user
        2. ANALYSIS        — Deep analysis with live progress display
        3. FINDINGS TABLE  — Structured results with severity / priority
        4. RECOMMENDATIONS — Prioritised action list (quick wins first)
        5. NEXT STEPS      — Suggested follow-up commands
        ```

        ## UI Conventions

        | Symbol | Meaning              |
        |--------|----------------------|
        | ✓      | Passed / complete    |
        | ✗      | Failed / critical    |
        | ⚠      | Warning / review     |
        | ⟳      | In progress          |
        | ░      | Pending              |
        | 🔴     | Critical severity    |
        | 🟠     | High severity        |
        | 🟡     | Medium severity      |
        | 🟢     | Low / informational  |

        Progress bars use block characters:
        `[████████░░] 80%`

        ## Quick Start

        ```bash
        # Install this skill
        cp -r . ~/.claude/skills/r00-vincenthopf-My-Claude-Code--security/

        # In Claude Code
        /read ~/.claude/skills/r00-vincenthopf-My-Claude-Code--security/SKILL.md
        ```

        Then simply describe your task and Claude will route to the
        appropriate command automatically.
